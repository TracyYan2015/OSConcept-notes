Process Synchronization Notes

Petersonâ€™s Algorithm
	1. Restricted to solve exclusive problem between two processes. 
	2. Algorithm:
		do{
			flag[i] = true;
			turn = j;
			while(flag[i] == true && turn == j)
				; // do nothing
			{ critical section }
			{ remainder section }
		
		}	while (true);
	3. It satisfies three requirement: a. mutual exclusion b. progress c. bounded waiting. (freedom from starvation)

Semaphore
	1. an integer variable which can only be accessed by 2 operations: signal() and wait()
	wait(S)
	{
		while S <= 0:
			; // do nothing
		S--;
	}

	signal(S){
		S++;
	}

Readers-Writers Problem
	First readers-writers problem: 
		a variation of the general readers-writers problem. It states that, the only situation for a reader process to be waiting is that there's one writer process is writing. (As long as no writing is occuring, any reader process can read from shared data.)
